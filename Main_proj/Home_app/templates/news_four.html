                ost smokers do successfully quit after their first attempt. 
                Switching patients from nicotine replacement therapy like the
                patch and lozenge to varenicline and increasing the dosage helped
                more people achieve abstinence from cigarettes, according to a new study. <br />

                The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial included 490 participants <br />
                who took 2 mg of varenicline or used a 21-mg nicotine patch and a 2-mg lozenge for
                the initial 6 weeks of their first attempt at quitting smoking.
              </p>

            <p>
                Participants who failed to abstain from cigarette smoking after
                the initial period were re-randomized to continue the same treatment,
                switch therapies, or increase the dosages to â‰¥ 3 mg of varenicline or
                a 42-mg patch and lozenges for another 6 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data were analyzed over a 4-year period starting in 2015 of adults up
                to age 75 who smoked 20 cigarettes a day on average and did not have unstable
                psychiatric disorders.

            <p>
                After the initial intervention period, the prescription drug appeared
                to be more effective for smoking cessation: 22% of those who received 
                combined nicotine replacement therapy (CNRT) abstained from smoking 
                (95% credible interval [Crl], 12%-27%) and 36% abstained in the
                varenicline group (95% CrI, 30%-42%).

            </p>
            <p>
                For those who did not achieve abstinence after 6 weeks of using 
                nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), 14% eventually quit after switching 
                to varenicline for another 6 weeks; 14% achieved success after increasing 
                their NRT patch dosage; and 8% were successful who continued with their 
                original NRT dosage.

              <p class="text-black-50">
                <br>
                Based on his experience caring for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS),
                dermatologist Christopher Sayed, MD, said that an exhaustive battery of tests
                 is usually not required to diagnose early-stage HS, which can be mistaken for 
                 other conditions, such as an infection, folliculitis, and acne....
