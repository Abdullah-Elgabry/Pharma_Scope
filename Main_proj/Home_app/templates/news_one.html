                ased on his experience caring for patients with hidradenitis
                suppurativa (HS), <br />
                dermatologist Christopher Sayed, MD, said that an exhaustive battery
                of tests is usually not required to diagnose early-stage HS, which can
                be mistaken for other conditions, such as an infection, folliculitis,
                and acne. <br />
                
                
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
          According to 2019 guidelines from the United States and Canadian Hidradenitis 
          Suppurativa Foundations, the diagnostic criteria for HS in general are the presence 
          of typical lesions such as abscesses, nodules, and tunnels in classic locations like
           underarms, groins, and buttocks that recur over the course of at least 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>
              "There is no need for additional testing or imaging to make the diagnosis,"
              said Sayed, co-chair of the 2019 guidelines work group who sees patients at 
              the HS and Follicular Disorders Clinic at the University of North Carolina, 
              Chapel Hill, North Carolina. "In many ways, the diagnosis should be very simple 
              since the presentation is classic in most cases, though it can be confusing in the 
              first 6 months or so."

            <p>
              Prior to being diagnosed with Hurley stage I HS — characterized by
              recurrent nodules and abscesses with minimal scars, according to the 
              guidelines — most people figure they've been getting recurrent Staphylococcus
              aureus infections or are having trouble with ingrown hairs from shaving, he 
              continued. They may also say they get "boils" without an understanding of what 
              has been causing them.
            </p>
            <p>
            Early HS can mimic an intense folliculitis or furuncles that can sometimes be caused
             by Staphylococcus infections, but the history of persistence or recurrence for months,
              despite treatment that should cover something like a Staph infection is a major clue,"
               Sayed said. "Thanks to improved resources on the internet, more patients, compared to
                several years ago, come in asking about HS after they've done their own research. As public
                 awareness improves, hopefully this trend will grow, and patients will be diagnosed and treated
                  earlier." Family history is also a strong predictor of HS, since about half of patients have 
                  first-degree relatives who have a history of HS, he noted.
