                person died in Egypt as a result of receiving what is known as
                the Hitler injection <br />
                an injection used to quickly treat colds and influenza. <br />
                his injection is widely used without a prescription in many
                areas of Egypt, especially

              remote villages, and it gives a quick feeling of improvement, but
              most people do not know its risks. This injection consists of an
              antibiotic, cortisone, and vitamins, a formula that is not
              scientifically based and is not licensed to treat the common cold.

              caused by bacteria or fungi. In addition, using antibiotics
              without a doctor's supervision can cause anaphylactic shock, which
              can lead to death if not treated quickly.

              Cortisone is also not used to treat cases of influenza and colds.
              Rather, it is used to relieve severe swelling and pain in cases of
              acute pneumonia, and its use is prohibited without medical
              supervision due to its many side effects.

            <p>
              The Egyptian Ministry of Health has warned citizens against taking
              Hitler's injection under any circumstances, as this combination
              may cause a sharp drop in blood pressure, leading to cardiac
              arrest. The Ministry also warned against taking any injections or
              medications directly from pharmacies without consulting a
              specialist doctor, because treatment depends primarily on the
              correct diagnosis.
